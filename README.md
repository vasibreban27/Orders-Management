Orders-Management

1. Overview
 
A Java-based application focused on managing orders, developed likely as an academic assignment. The repository follows a structured layout consistent with Spring Boot applications.

2. Project Structure

src/main/java/utcn/        — Java source code (application logic, controllers, services, etc.)
PT_A3.pdf                  — Project requirements or documentation
.gitignore                 — Files excluded from version control
target/                    — Compiled output directory (build artifacts)

3. Features
   
Processes and tracks orders through an internal system.

Implements domain-specific logic based on project requirements outlined in PT_A3.pdf.

Provides organized and modular code structure for maintainability.

4. Suggested Enhancements
   
Add a user-facing interface: CLI or web frontend for easier order management.

Connect to a database (e.g., MySQL) to persist order data and improve reliability.

Introduce validation and error-handling for robustness.

Develop unit and integration tests to ensure functionality and facilitate maintenance.

Improve documentation by including usage examples and sample data.

Consider containerization (e.g., with Docker) to simplify deployment.
